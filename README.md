## üé® Design Choices

The visual identity of Real Legacy Media is rooted in a retro aesthetic with some modern elements that pays homage to the golden age of physical music formats while remaining accessible and relevant for today‚Äôs digital users.

### Colour Scheme

The color palette combines warm, earthy tones with vintage appeal:

* #A86523 (brown) evokes classic record sleeves and aged materials

* #E9A319 (orange) and #FAD59A (peach) add nostalgic vibrance reminiscent of 70s‚Äì90s design motifs

* #FCEFCB (cream) softens the interface with a mellow background warmth

* #000000 (black) is used for text and contrast, grounding the aesthetic in simplicity and readability

This palette creates a clean, inviting visual hierarchy that avoids clutter and encourages browsing. Typography choices favor blocky, geometric fonts reminiscent of vintage album covers and arcade-era displays, while layouts are grid-based and responsive ‚Äî designed to scale smoothly across breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Additional design principles include:

* Functional retro: Elements like badges, buttons, and cards carry subtle nods to older interfaces but are built with modern CSS and UX patterns
* Consistent theming: Every UI element‚Äîfrom product cards to navigation bars‚Äîuses a cohesive visual style to reinforce brand identity

Together, these design choices create a shopping experience that feels nostalgic yet modern, appealing to users who value both the past and present of music culture.

### üóÇÔ∏è Wireframes/Designs

The wireframes for Real Legacy Media were created with a **mobile-first design strategy** in mind. These initial concepts focused on structuring core user flows ‚Äî such as browsing products, navigating categories, and completing checkout ‚Äî on small screens first, ensuring a responsive and accessible experience across all devices.

Each wireframe served as a foundational blueprint that guided the visual hierarchy, layout decisions, and component placement in the final UI. While the designs evolved through iteration and styling, the wireframes played a key role in shaping the overall structure and functionality of the finished site.

### üî§ Typography

The typography for Real Legacy Media was chosen to evoke a blend of retro style and modern readability ‚Äî reflecting the brand‚Äôs focus on nostalgic physical media with a contemporary digital experience.

#### üéµ Headings: `Brexon`
Brexon is a bold, geometric typeface used for headings, titles, and product names. Its sharp angles and blocky proportions convey a vintage poster feel, aligning with the brand‚Äôs retro music aesthetic. This choice reinforces the site's strong visual identity and helps key sections stand out.

### üì± Headings (Mobile Fallback): `Sigmar One`
On mobile devices where `Brexon` may not load reliably, the site falls back to **Sigmar One**, a rounded display font. While visually distinct, it retains the playful, expressive energy of the brand and maintains visual hierarchy on smaller screens and aligns with the initial blocky/vintage style Brexon provides.

#### ü™Ñ Body Text: `Kodchasan`
Kodchasan - Used for product descriptions, is a clean, sans-serif font optimized for readability across screen sizes. It complements Brexon without competing with it, and provides a neutral, friendly tone for paragraphs, product descriptions, and UI elements.

Both fonts are used in **black** for maximum legibility against the site‚Äôs light and peach-toned backgrounds.

> Overall, the typography supports a cohesive user experience by balancing style with functionality ‚Äî bold enough to make an impression, clear enough to shop with ease.

## üìä Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The Real Legacy Media platform is structured using Django‚Äôs ORM and a fully normalized relational database. The schema is designed to support a digital storefront for physical and digital music products, with support for user management, cart handling, order processing, and Stripe-integrated checkout.

- **User Profiles:** Django‚Äôs built-in `User` model is extended via a `Profile` model using a one-to-one relationship. Profiles store personal information like address, country, contact number, date of birth, and musical preferences (`favorite_genre`).

- **Product Catalog:** Products are organized by `Category`, and also linked to a `Genre` (e.g., hip-hop, classical) and `MediaType` (e.g., vinyl, CD, digital download). Each `Product` includes price, stock level, sale information, and timestamp metadata. Associated images are stored in the `ProductImage` model, allowing for ordering and main image designation.

- **Shopping Cart:** The `CartItem` model acts as a many-to-many join between `User` and `Product`, storing the quantity selected. This allows users to maintain a session-based or persistent cart before purchasing.

- **Orders:** Once a user checks out, their items are stored in an `Order` model which tracks shipping details, status, and order totals. Each product purchased is saved in the related `OrderItem` model, capturing the quantity and price at the time of sale.

- **Checkout (Stripe Integration):** Stripe-driven payments are tracked using the `CheckoutOrder` model. This includes an `order_session` (Stripe session ID), a unique `order_number`, and a record of the user's name, email, address, total paid, and payment status. This model allows full decoupling of order creation from payment confirmation, improving payment integrity and security.

This ERD supports scalability, modular development, and seamless payment workflows, while maintaining clean separation of user data, catalog logic, and transactional records.
